&nbsp;&nbsp;Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organizations involved.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "protected area" also includes marine protected areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and transboundary protected areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas.
    
<br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation, often providing habitat and protection from hunting for threatened and endangered species. Protection helps maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-managed conserved areas help preserve species and their habitats for present and future generations by reducing direct human development stresses. The indicators report proportions of Canada's territory conserved through protected areas and other conservation measures.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National conserved areas. Key results : As of the end of 2018, 11.2% of Canada's terrestrial area (land and freshwater) was conserved, including 10.9% in protected areas, 7.9% of its marine territory was conserved, including 3.1% in protected areas. The terrestrial area conserved has increased by 66% in the last 20 years, and by 6% in the last 5 years. The marine area conserved has increased by a factor of more than 16 in the last 20 years, and by more than 5 times in the last 5 years.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errestrial conserved areas, by province and territory. Key results : The proportion of terrestrial area (land and freshwater) conserved varies by province and territory. It ranges from 3.6% in Prince Edward Island to 15.3% in British Columbia
. Included in 2018, are Edéhzhíe Indigenous Protected Area, which added 14 000 km2 of protect area in the Northwest Territories
Birch River Wildland Provincial Park, Kazan Wildland Provincial Park and Richardson Wildland Provincial Park, which added 11 000 km2 of protected area in Alberta
recognition of 30 000 km2 of conservation zones in the Sahtu Land Use plan in the Northwest Territories.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCA), are established and managed to protect and conserve representative marine areas for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people of Canada and the world. The purpose of NMCAs is to achieve ecological sustainability in these areas, create enjoyable experiences for visitors, promote awareness and understanding among Canadians, and provide benefits for Indigenous peoples and coastal communities.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine ecosystems are fundamentally different from terrestrial environments. And human use in coastal regions, both on land and in the waters, has always been high. This means the effects of human activity -- from degradation of coastal habitats, to land and water pollution, to over-exploitation of resources - can also be high, and often far-reaching.

Because many human uses continue within their boundaries, national marine conservation areas do not try to protect marine ecosystems in a state essentially unaltered by human activity - the primary goal for national parks. National marine conservation areas focus instead on ecologically sustainable use, which means harmonising conservation practices with human activities. This approach involves working closely with others who use the coastal land and the water, and striving to reach common goals - most importantly a healthy, sustainable ecosystem.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human uses such as fishing and shipping, for example, are allowed in national marine conservation areas. But they would be limited or even eliminated from zones protecting sensitive features such as nesting areas, spawning beds, whale calving areas and cultural sites. And they would be carefully managed to protect the greater ecosystem. Other activities, namely ocean dumping, undersea mining and oil and gas exploration and development, are not permitted in a national marine conservation area.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each national marine conservation area is a gateway to nature, adventure, learning and discovery, offering visitors the opportunity to connect with a major marine environment, both above and below the surface (or both onshore and offshore), including:
<ul>
<li>(1)geological features; </li>
<li>(2)water in its various forms; </li>
<li>(3)marine and coastal habitats; </li>
<li>(4)a wide diversity of wildlife;</li>
<li>(5)archaeological and historic features.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitors can hike along coastlines shaped over millennia, observe powerful tides and currents, watch sea birds dive and soar over traditional nesting sites, explore the captivating world of a tidal pool, kayak through scenic island archipelagos, dive through waters teeming with unique marine life, discover intriguing underwater archaeological sites, and more.

Enhanced by Parks Canada's visitor programs and activities, the opportunities to learn about these unique marine environments, and to develop a deeper understanding for the threats they face and the natural values they support, are many, varied, and unforgettable.

<!-- 04 George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary consists of nearly 300 hectares (850 acres) of managed wetlands, natural marshes and low dykes in the heart of the Fraser River Estuary. For the millions of birds seeking feeding and resting areas during their annual migrations along the Pacific Coast, the Sanctuary is ideally located. It is a place where wildlife and their habitats are protected from harm, and it lies next to miles of flat marshland and the farmland of Westham Island.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary is located on the outskirts of the Village of Ladner, in Delta, BC. In the early 1900's, protective dykes had been built along the Fraser River to protect Ladner's thriving farming and fishing-based community from the Fraser River and the tidal waters of the Strait of Georgia. Nearby river islands, though, were only partially dyked or left to flood each year naturally, and were often sites of fishing camps which supplied the numerous local salmon canneries.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northwest part of Westham Island consisted of such undyked islands when George C. Reifel bought his property in 1927. Natural river channels such as Ewen, Robertson and Fuller Sloughs dissected the property and retain their names still within the Sanctuary waterways. Although all equipment and building materials needed to be barged in, by 1929, Mr. Reifel had created a large recreational family retreat in this idyllic location. <br><br>Dykes and causeways were constructed to create waterfowl habitats and road access connecting his land ("Reifel Island") to the rest of Westham Island. Although the family ran successful real estate and brewery businesses, Reifel Farm, as it became known, was also very successful, and during WW2 was responsible for over one-third of the sugar beet seed production of Canada.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gist Ranch Conservation Area is in Texas County, approximately five miles west of Summersville and 14 miles east of Houston.

Gist Ranch is a local name for this tract of land. The Conservation Department purchased this property in 1997 from Smith Flooring Company of Mountain View.

The area is contained in one contiguous tract and is heavily forested. Visitors to the area will find abundant populations of deer, turkey, and other forest wildlife species.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of natural communities can be found on Gist Ranch CA. These include small springs and wetlands (also called "fens"). The spring and fen areas host wildflowers like orange coneflower and cowbane and provide valuable habitat for salamanders, frogs, and other wildlife.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small dolomite glades, surrounded by savanna, also occur on the ridges, and on south- and west-facing slopes on Gist Ranch CA. These areas support a diverse flora, including little bluestem, leadplant, wild quinine, blazing star, and rattlesnake master. They also serve as important foraging spots for deer, turkey, and quail.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservation Department is working to improve the area for visitors by constructing ponds and lakes, grading or paving roads and building camping and picnic facilities. Watershed stabilization, upland wildlife habitat practices, and forest management are being implemented.
